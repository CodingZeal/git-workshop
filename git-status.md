# Getting the `Status` of Your New Repository

Now we have a brand new repository cool, but how do we know whats going it with? Let's try the `status` command:
```
git status
```

`git status` displays the state of our current work. It helps use know what files are new and files that have changes.

After running `git status` you should see something like this:

```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        cool-file.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Now that we know there are some "Untracked file" what next?
