# Using Github as our online backup

Up till this point all your work has been on your local git repository living on your computer. This is ok till something goes wrong on your computer and the result might be losing all your work and the history of all the changes you ever made.

## Enter Github

GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software.

It's like a Dropbox/Google Drive/Whatever file backup system but for CODE! With a ton of cool features and collaboration tools.

Now let's create an account if you dont have one
